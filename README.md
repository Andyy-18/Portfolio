My portfolio project is a showcase of my expertise in web development, employing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Leveraging Tailwind CSS, I've crafted a sleek and responsive design, while TypeScript ensures type safety and enhances code maintainability. This project highlights my proficiency in front-end technologies and my ability to create modern, user-friendly web applications.
